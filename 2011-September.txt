Subject: [Sccs-devel] SCCS v6 design discussuion
Message-ID: <4e5f8e7d.Q6FVICXI/YKSpS5Q%Joerg.Schilling@fokus.fraunhofer.de>

Hi all,

we are currently discussing the final design of the data structures for SCCS v6.

SCCS v6 will be a SCCS bases and SCCS/POSIX compatible extension that turns 
SCCS into a distributed source control system that supports changesets instead 
of just single file revisioning.

The SCCS sources did get a major rewrite in the recent past and SCCS is now 
more than 2.5 times faster than Sun SCCS and comsumes less than 1/4.7th of the 
CPU time needed by Sun SCCS.

>From my current tests SCCS has the chance to become by far the fastest 
distributed OSS source control system - even if I later add support for 
compressed archives.

I am currently discussing the new data structures on the phone with a friend 
but I would love to have a discussion with more interested people in order to 
make SCCS fit best the needs of people.

Please give a note when you are interested to participate inthe discussion.
