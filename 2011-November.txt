Subject: [Sccs-devel] New SCCS version 5.06 available
Message-ID: <4eb279b8.1mlnlZOzNItSjP0y%Joerg.Schilling@fokus.fraunhofer.de>

Hi all, 

sccs 5.06 is out and it now incorporates most of the fundamental new stuff that 
is needed to finally implement the code to support change-sets in SCCS.

This implementation will re-use some of the ideas found in the BitKeeper 
repositories for Linux:

	ftp://82.96.64.7/pub/linux/kernel/people/marcelo/linux-2.4/

As I did make many performance tests that check whether I am on the right way 
to make SCCS able to support large projects over more than 30 years of 
development, the implementation for the change-set bracketing may now start.

We still need a portable replacement for the syscall "resolvepath()" on Solaris 
to be able to correctly deal with all possible degenerated path arguments....


If you like to discuss the concepts, you are welcome to ask ot discuss in this 
mailing list.
