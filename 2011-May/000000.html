New features of SCCS-1.1:

Please note that this SCCS version and all our earlier versions are based on
what AT&amp;T called SCCS-5.0.

This is why the final version of this release will be called SCCS-5.1.

SCCS-5.1 is a mature and highly portable variant created from the original AT&amp;T
SCCS sources as supplied by Sun Microsystems in December 2006 on my request.
SCCS-5.1 introduces a few enhancements to the SCCS history file format that are
all compatible with other SCCS implementations (SCCS from SCO implements a clash
with the 'x' history file flag and may cause related SCCS-5.1 files to be
extracted with the executabl bit on). I recommend to replace SCO SCCS by this
current SCCS as SCO SCCS is based on older source code versions that is known
to have other bugs.

There has been a SCCS history file format change when switching from SCCS-3.0
to SCCS-4.0 on February 22 1977. Since then, the file format was kept the same.
SCCS-6.0 will introduce a new SCCS history file format that causes historic SCCS
implementations to abort (to prevent file corruption) but that can be easily
converted back into a SCCS-5.x history file using a conversion program.
This conversion will however cause a loss of information. The weave delta format
as introduced by Marc J. Rochkind at Bell Labs seems to be the best way of
dealing with deltas and branches and thus will be retained in SCCS-6.0. The
planned enhancements for SCCS-6.0 are:

-	New and better checksum (this is intended to cause historic SCCS versions
	to abort when reading the first line already).

-	Introducing a global project tree related lock file to allow SCCS to
	support atomic updates on whole projects and not only on single files.
	This is why we need to cause older SCCS implementations to abort as they
	otherwise would ignore the global lock and modify single files from the
	project.

-	Switching all time stamps in SCCS history files and p.* files to GMT in
	order to make SCCS able to be used in a networked environment.
	Previous versions use local time for time stamps.

-	The ability to have compressed delta weave data will cause the SCCS 
	history files to be typically smaller than the &quot;gotten&quot; release of
	the file.

-	A new &quot;escaped delta weave&quot; format will permit ^A to appear at the
	beginning of lines in text files. This format allows any file content
	that does not include null bytes.

-	A new subcommand &quot;sccs init&quot; will mark a project's root directory and
	switch SCCS into &quot;project mode&quot; as opposed to the historic
	&quot;single file mode&quot;.

-	A new subcommand &quot;sccs clone&quot; will permit to import projects from a
	distributed SCCS server.

-	A new subcommand &quot;sccs pull&quot; will allow to update a private copy from
	the state of a distributed SCCS server.

-	A new subcommand &quot;sccs push&quot; will allow to update a distributed SCCS
	server from a private copy.

-	A new subcommand &quot;sccs export&quot; will export changesets as annotated
	patch files.

-	A new subcommand &quot;sccs import&quot; will import annotated patch files.

There are only a few additional features that could turn SCCS into a distributed
Source Code Control System.

Please join the discussion mainling list for the development of enhancements on:

------------ Included in Beta-1

-	Several enhancements to the makefile system.

-	The makefile system now supports to compile using Sun Studio on Linux

-	-I. removed from the makefile system

-	The makefile system now better handles the LD_RUN_PATH property

-	Support for HAIKU was added

-	Support for AIX was added

-	Support for IRIX was added

-	Support for VMS was added

-	Floating point support for AIX now supports newer versions of AIX

-	libgetopt separated from libschily

-	libschily is now delivered complete

-	New library libfind to support sccs -R

-	sccs(1) now correctly calls readdir(3) to skip &quot;.&quot; and &quot;..&quot;

-	sccs(1) now uses strsignal(3) where available

-	sccs(1) now supports a flag -R for recursive operation on most
	commands.

	Most subcommands now support the -R option (before the subcommand).

	sccs -R tell		Lists all currently edited files
	sccs -R get		Get's everytrhing from SCCS/s. files
	sccs -R diffs		shows the diffs for all edited files
	sccs -R diffs ` sccs -R tell -U ` shows the diffs for all files edited by you
	sccs -R delget		performs a &quot;delta&quot; and a &quot;get&quot; on all files
				currently edited
	sccs -R unedit		removed _all_ edited files be careful!
	sccs -R val		Lists all corrupted SCCS history files
	sccs -R val -T		Gives more information on all corrupted 
				SCCS history files, to help to fix them.

	There are more sub-commands that support -R

	For sub-commands that (currently) do not support recursion, the
	following message is printed:

	sccs -R admin
	sccs: Recursion not supported for &quot;admin&quot;

	*** Please test and report!

-	SCCS get and SCCS delta implement a (hidden) option -Cdir to
	support recursive operation with sccs(1).

-	SCCS get -k now works correctly even if someone previously called
	sccs admin -fy...

-	SCCS get(1) now has new keywords %d% %e% %g% %h% with
	4 digit year strings

	sccs get ... only expands the new four digit-year keywords
	%d% %e% %g% %h% if the 'x' flag has been set with sccs admin or
	if the related keyword has been exlicitely enabled via the 'y'
	flag.

	This has been done because the probabiltiy thar lower case characters
	from printf() format strings incorrectly match sccs keywords is too high.

-	SCCS get(1) now implements the BSD-4.x keyword %sccs.include.filename%
	use sccs admin -fy* for selectively enabling/disabling this feature
	The file &quot;filename&quot; is searched in the path from the environment
	SCCS_INCLUDEPATH

-	On platforms without strftime(3), sccs get now correctly creates
	2 digit strings for Month and Day according to the man page

-	SCCS prs(1) now has new keywords :d: :DY: with 4 digit year strings

-	sccs help now supports new help target &quot;get_keywds&quot; for a list with
	get(1) keywords

-	sccs help now includes help for the sccs(1) command

-	SCCS commands now all support -V/--version to verify the
	current version.

-	All commands now use vfork() if available in order to speed things
	up and in order to permit to support VMS.

-	SCCS now installs a &quot;sccs&quot; symlink to /opt/schily/bin

-	The sccs-admin man page is now complete

-	Many small enhancements of all man pages

-	All SCCS commands now open files using O_BINARY on platforms where
	this is needed

-	SCCS admin now supports a new flag 'x' to enable Schily specific enhancements

-	All SCCS commands now create 4 digit year numbers in all files in case
	that the related date is past January 19 2038. 

	This is no problem as all relevant SCCS implementations have been
	enhanced to understand and to silently accept 4 digit year numbers in 1999.

	This is useful, as you need 64 bit SCCS binaries anyway in order to deal
	with later dates.

-	All SCCS code is now 64 bit clean.

-	All SCCS programs now link to libintl for localized strings.

-	SCCS &quot;val&quot; now supports directory type command line arguments that
	result in scanning the related directory for s. files.

-	The val(1) cmmand now includes a -T (debug) option that allows to get 
	much better mesages when a SCCS history file is corrupted. Use:
	sccs val -T filename

-	The SCCS man pages have been enhanced in order to include the -V (retrieve
	program version) option.

-	The man page sccsfile.1 now mentiones the new 'x' flag for the enhanced SCCS
	keywords.

-	The man page for sccs.1 and val.1 now mention the -T option

-	Added missing directories to the SCCS package description file.

-	The included diff(1) command now supports wide chars

-	The included diff(1) command now supports the -N option

-	sccslog(1) now detects currupted history files

-	sccslog(1) now deals with very old SCCS history files (from 1980 and before)
	that may have no delta comment at all.

-	sccslog(1) now implements a (hidden) option -Cdir to
	support recursive operation with sccs(1).

-	sccs(1) now supports a new subcommand &quot;ldiffs&quot; to call the platform local
	diff(1) implementation instead of the diff implementation delivered with
	SCCS.

-	A compile variant of the SCCS system (use &quot;smake COPTX=-DGMT_TIME&quot;)
	that results is a SCCS system that archives GMT based times inside
	the SCCS history files has been made more more robust and more correct.

	This compile variant has been introduced by Sun a while ago, but it
	was not cleanly portable and it did not work correctly when close to
	a DST switch time, as it abused the function localtime(), introduced
	math based on &quot;timezone&quot; and assumed that all DST variants add one
	hour to the winter time.

	The new code is based on a new function mkgmtime() that only needs
	to know the Gregorian calendar and based on correct usage of the POSIX
	time functions. 

	The change is a preparation for a future enhancement to SCCS that
	will make it time zone independent.

------------ Included in Beta-2

-	SCCS now checks whether the 'x' flag in the SCCS history files has the
	tag &quot;SCHILY&quot;, as the SCO sccs implementation uses the x flag for setting
	the executable permission on files.

-	SCCS now warns if currently unsupported uppercase flags are present in
	a history file.

-	sccs help now includes help for all help codes

-	The sccsfile.4 man page now mentiones that year numbers may be 4 digit
	numbers also.

-	The sccslog(1) command now implements a new option -a to control the way
	sccslog collects deltas with the same delta comment in case they happen 
	within 24 hours. Not collecting such deltas makes it easier to understand
	the exact time line in changes for many files that belong to a common
	project.

	sccslog -a will still collect time stamps that differ less than a minute
	sccslog -aa will not collect time stamps if they differ more than a
	second

-	The diff(1) command delivered with SCCS now outputs the correct time stamp
	format for unified diffs (-u) as required by POSIX. This is needed in order
	to be able to automatically remove removed files by patch(1).

-	The SCCS commands now switch to 4 digit year numbers in SCCS files when
	the year 2038 starts. This makes it easier to write shell scripts that
	work on SCCS files.

-	Since SCCS no longer uses the libc variable &quot;timezone&quot;, a call to tzset()
	is no longer required. Since SCCS now switches to a 4 digit year format
	at the beginning of Y2038 local time, we need to call tzset() again, but
	we now do it in main() for each related tool.

-	The leap year functions did not correctly know that February 2000 has
	29 days. This was a result from switching to a correct Gregorian leap
	year algorithm but using year-1900 as a parameter to the mosize()
	function.

-	SCCS comb now writes a shell script that has $(INS_BASE)/ccs/bin in
	front of PATH.

-	SCCS sccsdiff now has $(INS_BASE)/ccs/bin in front of PATH.

-	The string parsing functions now stop when encountering a null byte at
	the end of a line and thus no longer cause core dumps with corrupted
	SCCS history files.

-	SCCS val now checks for missing usernames in delta table lines. Missing
	usernames have been a frequent problem with SCCS releases until
	around 1982. Recent SCCS versions abort before modifying files when the
	username appears to be empty.

-	SCCS val now can check for non-monotone time stamps in SCCS history
	files. SCCS creates time stamps but never really uses them except when
	a cut-off time has been specified. Call val -T to enable this check.
	The exit code will not change and only a warning will be emmited in case
	of a non-monotonic time.

-	The SCCS admin command now supports a new option -o that uses the
	original file time for the initial delta instead of using the current
	time.

-	The SCCS delta command now wupports a new option -o that uses the
	original file time for the delta instead of using the current time.

-	The sccs command now avoids a GCC warning related to array of struct
	initialization.

-	The SCCS admin and delta man pages now mention -o

-	The SCCS val man page now includes a better description for the debug
	option -T.

-	The sccs.1 man page now contains an overview on the subcommands

-	The sccs.1 man page now mentions the new option -o for &quot;admin&quot; and
	&quot;delta&quot; and for related pseudo commands.


SCCS now has been tested to compile and work on the following platforms:

-	SunOS-4.x

-	SunOS-5.x (Solaris 2.x, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11)

-	FreeBSD

-	HP-UX

-	Linux

-	Mac OS X

-	AIX

-	IRIX

-	VMS

-	Cygwin

The portability now reached a state that should allow SCCS to compile 
and run on other platforms too. SCCS compiles and has been verified
on all major platforms.
