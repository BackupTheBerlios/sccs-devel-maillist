<PRE>A new step towards the next final release is ready.



Please note that this SCCS version and all our earlier versions are based on
what AT&amp;T called SCCS-5.0.

This is why the final version of this release will be called SCCS-5.1.

SCCS-5.1 is a mature and highly portable variant created from the original AT&amp;T
SCCS sources as supplied by Sun Microsystems in December 2006 on my request.
SCCS-5.1 introduces a few enhancements to the SCCS history file format that are
all compatible with other SCCS implementations (SCCS from SCO implements a clash
with the 'x' history file flag and may cause related SCCS-5.1 files to be
extracted with the executabl bit on). I recommend to replace SCO SCCS by this
current SCCS as SCO SCCS is based on older source code versions that is known
to have other bugs.

There has been a SCCS history file format change when switching from SCCS-3.0
to SCCS-4.0 on February 22 1977. Since then, the file format was kept the same.
SCCS-6.0 will introduce a new SCCS history file format that causes historic SCCS
implementations to abort (to prevent file corruption) but that can be easily
converted back into a SCCS-5.x history file using a conversion program.
This conversion will not cause a loss of information as the new information will
be encoded as special comment that is accepted by all other SCCS implementations
except for currently &quot;CSSC&quot;. The weave delta formatas introduced by
Marc J. Rochkind at Bell Labs seems to be the best way of dealing with deltas 
and branches and thus will be retained in SCCS-6.0. The planned enhancements for
SCCS-6.0 are:


	.... please read the file &quot;AN-1.1&quot; from the distribution for more
	information



------------ Included in Beta-3

-	SCCS admin no longer silently removes flags from the range 'A'..'Z'
	from the SCCS history file. SCCS admin now aborts in case that there
	is a flag in the range 'A'..'Z'. This is not a problem, as there is
	no known SCCS implementation that currently uses uppercase flags.
	Extremely outdated BitKeeper versions from before 1998 did.... but they
	do no longer exist.

-	SCCS &quot;admin -fy s.foo&quot; now not only turns off keyword expansion but also
	turns off the &quot;No iy keyword&quot; warning for &quot;admin&quot;, &quot;delta&quot; and &quot;get&quot;.

-	SCCS &quot;admin&quot; and &quot;delta&quot; now correctly check for expanded keywords the
	same way as the enhanced &quot;get&quot; command does.

-	SCCS get now implements a new -o (original file date) option for
	orthogonality with the -o flag already introduced in &quot;admin&quot; and
	&quot;delta&quot;.

-	The sccsfile.4 and sccs-admin.1 man pages now mention the optional
	parameter to the 'i' flag in the SCCS history file introduced by Sun.
	This parameter permits to require a specific SCCS keyword string
	to be expanded in order to prevent to deny the related &quot;admin&quot;,
	&quot;delta&quot; or &quot;get&quot; command.
	The parameter to the 'i' flag was introuced by Sun but it is also
	available on HP-UX and AIX.

-	The sccs-get.1 man page now mentions the -L option introduced by Sun.

-	The diff(1) man page has been added

-	The SCCS prt command now correctly adds a newline when printing the
	&quot;encoded&quot; ('e') flag via prt -f ...

-	The SCCS prt command now prints labels for the 's', 'x' and 'y' flags
	with prt -f. The label for 'x' is &quot;extensions&quot;, the labels for 's'
	and 'y' are the same labels as used by the &quot;prs&quot; program.

-	All SCCS programs are now able to deal with time stamps in the range
	2038 .. 2068 in history-files even with 32 bit programs that use a
	signed int for time_t. This however does not affect problems caused
	by the OS on such platforms.

-	The switch to 4-digit year numbers is done at January 1 2038 for the
	s-file and at January 1 2069 for all files that are mentioned in
	POSIX (e.g. the l-file and the p-file). The latter is done to follow
	the POSIX standard. The first is possible al POSIX does not define
	the file format for the s-file.

-	date_ab() now supports reading dates &lt; 1969 in 4-digit mode from
	delta entries in SCCS history files.

-	date_ba() now always prints 2-digit year numbers even for e.g. 2120.

-	SCCS now supports to specify cutoff dates using 4-digit year numbers
	by specifying something like:

	yyyy/[mm[dd[hh[mm[ss]]]]]

-	The man pages sccs-get.1 and sccs-prs.1 now mention how to specify
	a 4-digit year with a cutoff date.

-	The SCCS admin program now permits to specify binary mode via -b
	and -n even in case that the new SCCS history file is not initialized
	with -i. A history file created with &quot;admin -n s.foo&quot; will still
	not include the 'e' flag at all. James Youngman promised to permit
	&quot;admin -r2 -n s.foo&quot; with CSSC in return....

-	The SCCS commands now switches to 4 digit year numbers in SCCS files
	when the year is &lt; 1969 or if the year is &gt; 2068. This switch is
	done for all files, as this is outside the time range mentioned by
	POSIX.

-	The SCCS prs command now prints &quot;extensions&quot; for the 'x' flag

-	SCCS &quot;sccs unedit&quot; now also works on Linux. The problem was
	caused by using /tmp/sccsXXXXX instead of /tmp/sccsXXXXXX for mkstemp()

-	A test suite has been added in directory &quot;sccs/tests&quot;.
	The test suite contains two parts:

	-	1188 tests taken from CSSC (James Youngman)
		The related tests are in &quot;sccs/tests/cssctests&quot;

	-	Additional tests from the SCCS project (Joerg Schilling).
		The related tests are in &quot;sccs/tests/sccstests&quot;

	The tests have recently been run with success on SunOS, AIX, CYGWIN,
	HP-UX, Linux, Mac OS X.

	Please run tests on the other OS and report.

	To run the test, just type:

		smake

	from the directory &quot;sccs/tests&quot; after you compiled SCCS at top level.
	For more information, have a look at: sccs/tests/README

	Check the output for problems that are flagged by the word FAIL or XFAIL.

	Please report any problems!

	Note that some operating systems do not support everything.

	-	HP-UX will e.g. fail on some tests with &quot;Arg list too long&quot;.

	-	AIX will fail with all dates before 1970 January 1
		as the time functions in libc return -1 or such dates
		and this will lead to dates like: 69/12/31 23:59:59
